    <h2>Welcome to the bonfire, Unkindled One.</h2>
    <p>
        I tend to this website which is under renovation. Since the Lords 
        have left their thrones, I mean, I got pre-occupied in the past 
        couple of years with my job, so yeah...
    </p>

        I am trying to go back to poking around with web dev. And a perfect 
        way to rekindle the fire is by refactoring my website which 
        <em>just works</em> a few years ago before I forgot about it.
