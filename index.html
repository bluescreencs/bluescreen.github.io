<p>Welcome to my website. I'm an amateur gAmEr, unpaid-amnesiac-web-developer, mediocre classical guitarist and an underachieving intramural-level athlete.</p>

<p>I like to write and talk about tech related topics, video games, sports (basketball) and music (the guitar part). I'm also interested in STEM, Philosophy, History, Geography, humour, satire, personal well-being and other subjects with lame and absurd labels.</p>

<p>So like, subscribe, follow, comment, share and donate on my pages so I don't have to resort on doing "things" on cam. /s</p>

<p>cheers!</p>
