<p><h2>Welcome to the bonfire, Unkindled One.</h2></p>

<p>Greetings fellow human, I go by the pseudonymn aL; welcome to my website. I am in the field of Technical Design by day and I am on my bed sleeping at night, though I also render overtime and graveyard shifts occasionally. I'm an amateur gAmEr, amnesiac-web-developer, mediocre classical guitarist and an underachieving intramural athlete.</p>

<p>I dropped out of Engineering to pursue minimum wage jobs, because r/iamverysmart. A decade since, I am now just slightly above the minimum wage pay grade, I know right?</p>

<p>I like to write and talk about tech related topics, video games, sports (basketball) and music (the guitar part). I'm also interested in STEM, Philosophy, History, Geography, humour, satire, personal well-being and other subjects that I have no idea what they are labelled.</p>

<p>So like, subscribe, follow, comment, share and donate on my pages so I don't have to resort on doing "things" on cam. /s</p>

<p>cheers!</p>
