    <h2>Welcome to the bonfire, Unkindled One.</h2>
    <p>
        I tend to this website which is under renovation. Since the Lords 
        have left their thrones, I mean, I got pre-occupied in the past 
        couple of years with my job, so yeah...
    </p>
    <p>
        I am trying to go back to poking around with web dev. And a perfect 
        way to rekindle the fire is by refactoring my website which 
        <em>just works</em> a few years ago before I forgot about it.

        Anyway, here's some random quotations to ponder upon Ashen One.

    <figcaption class="quotes">
    {% for quote in site.quotes limit: 1 %}
        <blockquote>
          {{ quote.content | markdownify }}
        </blockquote>
        <figcaption>
            &mdash; {{ quote.author }}
        </figcaption>
    {% endfor %}
    </figcaption> -->
